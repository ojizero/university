# Research finder
As part of a work made by me and a few of my friends to renew our department's website, this program (plugin of Wordpress) was requested to retrieve the latest research papers made by our proffessors from the internet and add them as pending posts on the new website.
This program is made of two parts, the first is a `Ruby` script which is the core of the program, it searches Google Scholar, then parses the HTML page retrieved. The second is a PHP wrapper, used to communicate with the Wordpress database.

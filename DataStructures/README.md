# Data Structures course
The codes are written in C.

## Assignment#1
Polynomials as ADT:

### File name:
Project#1_finalized.c
### Assignment Statement:
You have to implement a common application to Linked List: Polynomial ADT. In this assignment you have to implement Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction of polynomials. 
A user should be able to enter two polynomials in order to apply the mathematical operations on. Your application should show an appropriate screen with menu options to inform the user of the available operations to let her/him to choose from.
### Further into it:
This assignment is used to demonstrate Linked Lists, and the usefulness of them, using a common example implementing them.

## Assignment#2
Polynomials as ADT:

### File name:
Project#2_finalized.c
### Assignment Statement:
You have to implement a common application to Linked List: Polynomial ADT. In this assignment you have to implement Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction of polynomials. 
A user should be able to enter two polynomials in order to apply the mathematical operations on. Your application should show an appropriate screen with menu options to inform the user of the available operations to let her/him to choose from.
### Further into it:
This assignment is used to demonstrate stacks, and how to use them, in an example of transfering equations from infix to postfix format.


## Side note
The assignments aren't 100% perfect, they have a few errors, I am getting to fix them once I have free time.

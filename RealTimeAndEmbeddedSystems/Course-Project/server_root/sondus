		<p>If you can notice the client here is simply a normal web browser</p>
		<p>Since we are working on the HTTP standard, any web browser should be able to properly view and communicate with your server</p>
		<p>Ennu notice how this is a normal web browser<br />It is simply connecting to my machine on the 'localhost' domain<br />And I requested this page named 'sondus', and it is being displayed since I wrote it in HTML.</p>

A simple HTTP server software written in C as a Real Time system project, extremely basic with only respondes 200 and 404.

The implementation isn't the best out there, and there are a bunch of bugs, here and there, I may get to rewrite it at a later point of time (I actually began rewriting it, but I'm too lazy so yea)
